🌧️ Flood Prediction (Decision Tree &amp; Random Forest)  Merged 4 river datasets, cleaned the data, trained Decision Tree and Random Forest, and used both to predict floods. Both models gave slightly different counts but the same river ranking. Simple visuals compare predictions and show the most flood-prone river.
